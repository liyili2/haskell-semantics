1. Haskell export system problem. Does not check the name of the export module for a type/class-method. in ghci 8.0 version.

ex: module AStack( Stack(G.Empty), Test(AStack.xx), G.pop, top, size ) the AStack and G cannot be checked

2. Haskell module if the module name is omitted, it means that the module is a main and it does not show in any haskell documents. 

3. Haskell does not check if the exported module is a name replaced with the old name, and the new name might collipse with another existing name

4. Haskell does not check how many times a module is imported. The sum of all these modules is the result

5, undefinedness: if a module can import the same module twice, then if one is qualified and the other is not, the imported module entities will become unqualified.
